# JavaFXCleaningCentre
This application is intended for ordering a cleaning service for a client who has registered and successfully authenticated, 
as well as for a cleaning company manager who monitors current applications and registers new ones.

(The data for logging in to the manager's personal account you can find in the folder: course-db/managers.xml, 
to log in to the client's personal account, you must first register and then authenticate.)
